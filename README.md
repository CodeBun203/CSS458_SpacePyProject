    To ensure clear organization, file descriptions are listed here, either copy/paste here or fully written out.

## Driver.py
    For this file, it will be the drive all the files within our model. The purpose is to handle validation while checking the model's behavior and physics during simulation and calculation.

    There are some aspect that can change, but towards polishing this model, those will be noted for users. 

## Testing.py
     We wanted this file to help us handle calculation verification within our model. It will ensure we designed all the behaviors and implementations correctly and catch any critical errors. 

    What this file is verifying:
    - Gravitational Physics
        * Force Symmetric
        * Zero Distance

    - Lagrange Points
        * L4 (weakest) Point Stability

    - Elliptical Orbit
        * Orbit Consistency
    
    - Simulation Integration
        * Can our simulation file run our model without any issues?

## Simulation.py


## Body.py


## Visualization.py
File not created.

At this moment in time, we're focused on the calculations first before doing anything as far as displaying or visualizing. This will be the last file to be created.
