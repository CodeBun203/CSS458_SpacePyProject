# Information about Testing
Written by Avah Afshari for CSS 458, Spring 2025

### Overall
This is a silly little file that is being including into the github but it serves a purpose. It organizes the information from modeling and 'testing.py' into one file. All this information will then be extracted into the final report for this final project of this course. 

### testing.py
I want to make sure that part of this file would include the output of the files without having to download the model and run it locally. The table below explains the expected and actually output of each unit test that we had. Tests are subject to change (added, deleted, modified, etc.). 


| Test Name   | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Grav. Force Sym.  | --    | --    |
| Zero Distance  | --    | --    |
| l4 Point Stability  | --    | --    |
| Elliptical Orbit Consis.  | --    | --    |




### Modeling
I had to do a little bit of research to figure out the best way of implementing the modeling. Found out that it's possible to use 'matplotlib' to do 3D modeling.
